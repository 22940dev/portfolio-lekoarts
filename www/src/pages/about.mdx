**Hi, I'm Lennart.**<br /><br />
I'm a designer turned software engineer from Darmstadt, Germany. I currently work at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) on the open source project.
I'm passionate about working on open source products & building thriving communities around them.<br />
My [open source code](https://github.com/LekoArts) has been used by thousands of people & I regularly share educational content in the form of [posts](/writing), [presentations](/appearances), and videos.
